# Embedded System Design - Course topics

## Lecture 1: An overview of embedded systems design
- What are embedded systems?
- Motivations and challenges
- Main reference: Marwedel

## Lecture 2: System description with requirements and use-cases
- System design processes overview. V-Cycle overview.
- Describing systems with requirements and use-cases
- Reference: Marwedel

## Lecture 3: Design processes overview
- V-Cycle, Waterfall, Agile etc.

## Lecture 4: Introduction to Model-Based Design, Simulation and Analysis
- Models as system diagrams
- Model management
- Requirements traceability
- Modeling standards
- Physical components modeling approaches
- Algorithm modeling approaches
- Model verification


## Lecture 5: MBD Implementation. Transitioning to MBD
- Model discretisation
- Code generation from Simulink models
- Integration with external code
- Differences between traditional design and Model-Based Design
- Implementing a Model-Based Design strategy
- Best practices for Model-Based Design


## Lecture 6: Finite state machines
- System modeling with finite state machines: states, conditions, actions, state actions, hierarchy/super-states, default state / history, time, parallel states, actions
- Reference: Marwedel, our examples

## Lecture 7: Finite State machines (cont'd) and dataflow networks
- Other topics in finite state machines (Mealy/Moore, variables, simultaneity)
- Data flow networks (i.e. Simulink-like)

## Lecture 8: Embedded Systems Hardware
- Typical hardware used: processors, NvRam, sensors (input), actuators (motors)
- Design choices and tradeoffs:
   - custom processing units vs standard MCUs
   - fixed-point vs floating-point (include review of fixed-point arithmetic)
   - sensors and sampling issues (aliasing)

## Lecture 9: Embedded System Software
- Real-Time Operating Systems: why needed, what they do
- Controlling access to shared resources: mutex / critical sections, blocking, priority inversion strategy

## Lecture 10: Architecture
- Architecture of complex systems:
   - multiple ECUs, communication between them
- SW architecture: approaches, decompositions 

## Lecture 11: Application mapping
- Task scheduling strategies
- other stuff?

## Lecture 12: Autosar overview

## Lecture 13: Testing of Embedded Systems
- testing strategies: 

## Lecture 14
- Review and conclusions

## Misc topics - to locate
- Quantitative analysis (worst-case analysis etc) (Chap 16 from Lee Shesia)
- Book: "Intorduction to embedded systems", Lee2011
