# Embedded System Design - Course topics

##  Lecture 1: An overview of embedded systems design
- What are embedded systems?
- Motivations and challenges
- Main reference: Marwedel

##  Lecture 2: System description with requirements and  
- System design processes overview. V-Cycle overview.
- Describing systems with requirements and use-cases
- Reference: Marwedel

##  Lecture 3: Finite state machines
- System modeling with finite state machines: states, conditions, actions, state actions, hierarchy/super-states, default state / history, time, parallel states, actions
- Reference: Marwedel, our examples

##  Lecture 4: Finite State machines (cont'd) and dataflow networks
- Other topics in finite state machines (Mealy/Moore, variables, simultaneity)
- Data flow networks (i.e. Simulink-like)

##  Lecture 5: Model-Based Design
- to fill

##  Lecture 6: Model-Based Design
 - to fill

##  Lecture 7: Embedded Systems Hardware
- Typical hardware used: processors, NvRam, sensors (input), actuators (motors)
- Design choices and tradeoffs:
   - custom processing units vs standard MCUs
   - fixed-point vs floating-point (include review of fixed-point arithmetic)
   - sensors and sampling issues (aliasing)

##  Lecture 8: Embedded System Software
- Real-Time Operating Systems: why needed, what they do
- Controlling access to shared resources: mutex / critical sections, blocking, priority inversion strategy

##  Lecture 9: Architecture
- SW architecture: approaches, decompositions, multiple ECUs, 
- what else?

##  Lecture 10: Application mapping
- Platform and application components
- Task scheduling strategies
- other stuff

##  Lecture 11: Autosar overview?

##  Lecture 12:

##  Lecture 13: Testing of Embedded Systems
- testing strategies: 

##  Lecture 14
- Review 

# Notes
- we may lose 1 week during semester because of holidays
