# Embedded System Design - Laboratories topics

The main idea will be to take a physical plant (brushed electrical motor is the current proposal) and go with this through the entire Model Based Design Process, from modeling, simulation and control algorithm design to code generation and target deployment.

## Laboratory 1: Mathematical Modelling of a brushed electrical motor
- presentation of the physical plant
- understanding of the physical behavior
- determining the mathematical equation describing the physical behavior

## Laboratory 2: Introduction to Simulink Environment, simulation of a brushed electrical model
- introduction to Matlab/Simulink environment
- how to write a Matlab script
- Simulink standards library
- how to build and simulate a Simulink model
- implementation of the physical model of the brushed electrical model

## Laboratory 3: Model Validation for Simulink implementation of a brushed motor model
- acquiring data from the physical plant
- using the measurements for validating the Simulink implementation

## Laboratory 4: Design of a control solution based on given requirements
- control algorithm requirements
- design of the control algorithm
- implementation of the control solution into Simulink
- Simulation of the control algorithm together with the plant model

## Laboratory 5: Control algorithm discretization and code generation
- discretization of a Simulink model (control algorithm for the given plant)
- Simulink solvers and multi-rate systems
- customization of the code generator options

## Laboratory 6: Target Deployment and Functional Validation
- target deployment
- functional validation of the implementation

## Laboratory 7: Modelling standards (applying standards on your models algorithms)
- modelling standards (MISRA AC TL, dSpace Modelling Guideline, MAAB)
- checking and applying modelling standards on Simulink Model Advisor
